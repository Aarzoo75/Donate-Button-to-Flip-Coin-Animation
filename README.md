# Animated Donate Button to Flip-Coin
This is a fun, interactive donate button that flips a coin when clicked. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation
To use this donate button on your website, simply download the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files and include them in your project. You will also need to include a font library, such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), in the `index.html` file.

## Usage
To use the donate button, add the following code to your HTML file:
```HTML
  <button class="tip-button">
    <span class="tip-button__text">Send me a tip</span>
    <div class="coin-wrapper">
      <div class="coin">
        <div class="coin__middle"></div>
        <div class="coin__back"></div>
        <div class="coin__front"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </button>
```
You can customize the appearance of the button by modifying the CSS in the `style.css` file. The JavaScript in the `script.js` file handles the coin flip animation and can also be modified to fit your needs.
